**Prometheus & Grafana Blueprint** 

 Welcome to the Prometheus & Grafana blueprint project! This project aims to provide a flexible and dynamic infrastructure setup for deploying Prometheus and Grafana on various cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.

**Overview**

This blueprint project allows you to quickly deploy a monitoring and visualization stack using Prometheus and Grafana on your preferred cloud provider. The infrastructure setup is defined using Terraform configuration files, providing flexibility and portability across different cloud platforms.

**Prerequisites** 

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:
Terraform (vX.X.X or higher)
Cloud provider CLI tools (e.g., AWS CLI, Google Cloud SDK, Azure CLI)
Access to your cloud provider account and appropriate permissions to create resources

**Directory Structure** 

The project directory structure is organized as follows:

prometheus-grafana/terraform/

├── aws/
│ ├── main.tf
│ ├── variables.tf
│ ├── provider.tf
│ ├── terraform.tfvars
│ └── README.md

    AWS/, GCP/, Azure/: Directories containing infrastructure configurations for each cloud provider.
    main.tf:            Terraform configuration defining resources (e.g., VM instance, networking) for Prometheus and Grafana.
    variables.tf:       Declaration of input variables used in the Terraform configuration.
    provider.tf:        Configuration of the cloud provider credentials and settings.
    terraform.tfvars:   File containing Terraform variable values (secrets, configuration).
    README.md:          Instructions and documentation specific to each cloud provider.

**Usage**
To deploy Prometheus and Grafana on your preferred cloud provider, follow these steps:

Navigate to the directory of the desired cloud provider (aws/, gcp/, azure/).

Initialize the Terraform workspace:
     `terraform init`

Review and customize the variables.tf file according to your requirements.

Provide your cloud provider credentials and other configurations in the terraform.tfvars file.

Deploy the infrastructure:
     `terraform apply`

Follow the instructions in the respective README.md file for additional configuration and access details specific to each cloud provider.

## Prometheus & Grafana blueprint

Welcome to the Prometheus & Grafana blueprint project! This project aims to provide a flexible and dynamic infrastructure setup for deploying Prometheus and Grafana on various cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## Overview

This blueprint project allows you to quickly deploy a monitoring and visualization stack using Prometheus and Grafana on your preferred cloud provider. The infrastructure setup is defined using Terraform configuration files, providing flexibility and portability across different cloud platforms.

## Features

- Automated deployment of Prometheus and Grafana instances
- Dynamic configuration based on cloud provider
- Easily scalable and customizable
- Supports monitoring of various metrics and data sources
- Centralized dashboard for visualization and analysis

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:
- Terraform (vX.X.X or higher)
- Cloud provider CLI tools (e.g., AWS CLI, Google Cloud SDK, Azure CLI)
- Access to your cloud provider account and appropriate permissions to create resources

## Directory Structure

- **AWS/**, **GCP/**, **Azure/**: Directories containing infrastructure configurations for each cloud provider.
- **main.tf**: Terraform configuration defining resources (e.g., VM instance, networking) for Prometheus and Grafana.
- **variables.tf**: Declaration of input variables used in the Terraform configuration.
- **provider.tf**: Configuration of the cloud provider credentials and settings.
- **terraform.tfvars**: File containing Terraform variable values (secrets, configuration).
- **README.md**: Instructions and documentation specific to each cloud provider.


## Usage

To deploy Prometheus and Grafana on your preferred cloud provider, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired cloud provider (aws/, gcp/, azure/).
2. Initialize the Terraform workspace: `terraform init`
3. Review and customize the variables.tf file according to your requirements.
4. Provide your cloud provider credentials and other configurations in the terraform.tfvars file.
5. Deploy the infrastructure: `terraform apply`

Follow the instructions in the respective README.md file for additional configuration and access details specific to each cloud provider.

## Terraform Configuration Files

### `output.tf`

- **Description**: Defines the outputs of your infrastructure that you want to expose for external consumption or use within other Terraform projects.

### `locals.tf`

- **Description**: Contains local values or expressions that are used within your Terraform configuration but are not exposed as outputs.

### `backend.tf`

- **Description**: Specifies the backend configuration for storing Terraform state. This includes settings such as the backend type (e.g., S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage) and backend-specific configuration options.

### `data.tf`

- **Description**: Defines data sources that retrieve information from external systems or APIs. This can include fetching information about existing infrastructure, such as virtual networks, subnets, or IAM roles.

### `security.tf`

- **Description**: Contains security-related configurations, such as firewall rules, security groups, or IAM policies.

### `networking.tf`

- **Description**: Defines networking resources such as virtual networks, subnets, route tables, and load balancers.

### `compute.tf`

- **Description**: Contains configurations for compute resources like virtual machines, container instances, or serverless functions.

### `storage.tf`

- **Description**: Defines storage resources such as object storage buckets, block storage volumes, or databases.

### `monitoring.tf`

- **Description**: Contains configurations for monitoring and observability tools, such as Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-native monitoring services provided by your cloud provider.

### `logging.tf`

- **Description**: Defines configurations for logging and log management solutions, such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK stack), or cloud-native logging services.

### `notifications.tf`

- **Description**: Contains configurations for alerting and notification services, such as PagerDuty, Slack, or cloud-native notification services provided by your cloud provider.

### `deployment.tf`

- **Description**: Contains configurations for deployment-related tasks, such as deploying applications using tools like Kubernetes, Docker, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
